# TabBar

## Summary

Represents a primitive control that provides a list of selectable items. Changes to the selected item can be used to facilitate page navigation.

## Remarks

Being a primitive control, `TabBar` and `TabBarItem` do not include much of the functionality and design practices users expect by default. Depending on your design needs, you can use styles from the Uno.Themes library, or one of the [segmented controls](SegmentedControls.md) to improve the experience provided by this control.
